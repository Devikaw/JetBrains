Write a class that represents the coffee machine. The class should have a method that takes a string as input. 
Every time the user inputs a line (a string) to the console, the program invokes this method with one argument: the line that user input to the console. 
This system simulates pretty accurately how real-world electronic devices work. 
External components (like buttons on the coffee machine or tapping on the screen) generate events that pass into the single interface of the program.
